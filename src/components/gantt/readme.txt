How to run samples
------------

All the samples except for a few that explicitly require a REST backend api can be opened as static files.

Running the backend:

- `npm install` or `yarn install`
- `npm start` or `yarn start`
- go to `http://localhost:9200`

or

- copy `codebase` and `samples` folders of the package to your Apache/nginx directory and open samples as static html pages. Demos that require RESTful backend will not work in that case.

React Version
------------

The React version of the library is available as a separate package. It is a wrapper around the core library and provides React components for Gantt.

It is available under the Commercial, Enterprice, Ultimate and Evaluation licenses.

You can find the samples project for the React Gantt in `react-samples` folder of the package.
